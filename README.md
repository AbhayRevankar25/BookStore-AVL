## üìÇ Sample Book Inventory (bookList.csv)

The application reads from and writes to a CSV file named `bookList.csv` which stores the book inventory using the following format:

| BookId | BookName      | Author       | Quantity | Cost (‚Çπ) | Sell (‚Çπ) | Shelf No |
|--------|---------------|--------------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 101    | AtomicHabits  | JamesClear   | 20       | 150      | 200      | 3         |
| 102    | ZeroToOne     | PeterThiel   | 15       | 120      | 180      | 4         |

Each row contains:
- A unique `BookId`
- Book name and author
- Number of copies in stock (`Quantity`)
- `Cost` (internal purchase price)
- `Sell` (customer price)
- `Shelf No` for physical arrangement

Ensure this file exists in the same directory as the executable for the app to load properly.

You can add more entries manually or through the Admin mode in the program.
